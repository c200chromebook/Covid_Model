# Baseline Assumptions
## Simplifications:
* Homogenous population
* Deterministic Model (for now)
* Homogenous healthcare system (for now)
* No Reinfection or Resurrections
* Timing medians are very near averages.
* Deaths only occur in critical pool.
* Homogenous Incubation Period (please send info on this!)
* Asymptomatic people don't infect [(This is wrong!)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025866v2)
* Spread happens while in incubation or while sick
